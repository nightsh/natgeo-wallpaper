## Simple National Geographic Picture Of The Day scraper


### Usage

Simply invoke the script, but be sure to set your preferred 
paths before (just edit the thing, it doesn't have a config).

I chose to put this in a cron, so you can update daily the PotD
and maybe trigger the wallpaper redraw. Mine is managed by nitrogen
(on i3wm) and I usually call it after cron execution via `i3-msg`.


### Credits

Thanks to the original CPAN authors of the respective libraries used in 
the script and of course, NatGeo for providing amazing shots of wildlife
and beyond!
